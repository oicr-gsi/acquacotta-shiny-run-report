# Acquacotta
R Shiny App to display Run Reports generated by the OICR SeqWare pipeline.


## Action points
- [x] config file for hardcoded variables (path to run reports)
- [ ] try-catch on the shinyApp function (to not bring down the server)
- [ ] good example (screen shot)
- [ ] write tests with an example TSV file (de-identified)
- [ ] documentation! (this readme should have information how to start the server, through RStudio and links to docs for command line)
- [ ] add monitoring through Prometheus https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/
